I studied and worked among entrepreneurs over the last six years. As my appreciation and interest in computer development grew, I committed to shift from a facilitator to a creator. Currently working with the VP of Engineering at Villa to build the mobile and web applications. If you'd like to connect or learn more, take a look at my profiles above or send me an email. When I'm not coding, you can find me biking around Marin, playing guitar, or enjoying a long weightlifting session. All of my endeavors are fueled by passion and coffee.
