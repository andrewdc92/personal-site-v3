  <h3> Current Projects </h3>

  <h3> ><a href="https://www.usefomo.com/"> FOMO - Support Engineer</a></h3>
  <p> Fomo is a lightweight, high performance app that creates real-time social proof when users take action on websites, like making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter. It integrates with a wide array of popular services, including but not limited to: Shopify, Stripe, Paypal, Zapier, Instagram, and Facebook.  My goal is to help customers feel empowered and foster joy in their entrepreneurial ventures. I work to improve customer experiences by diagnosing and patching bugs while customizing Fomo's functionality to fit their goals </p>

  <h3> ><a href="https://gitlab.com/andrewdc92/blackworkers"> Blackworkers Project</a></h3>
  <p> Based off of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/blackworkers/">Blackworkers</a> Instagram page, this is an open project to create an interactive, searchable directory of blackwork-style tattoo artists and black and grey artists from around the world. The craft is more popular than ever before and many artists have limited exposure and resources to grow their trade. Increasing accessibility and exposure for artists without adding operating costs to their business was my goal, and I got the idea from meeting a particular artist who grew into the trade from putting simple sketches on Instagram. Her technique and training was recognized and now currently has close to 500,000 followers on Instagram. Individuals getting their first piece, and even seasoned veterans with numerous tattoos are susceptible to the marketing ploys of local shops, when there are quantifiable signs of skill and professionalism (regardless of style) that should be sought out before getting a piece. Don't get terrible tattoos. </p>
