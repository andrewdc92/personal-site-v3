  <h3> Past Projects </h3>

  <h3> ><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/villa-toolbox/id1207903837?mt=8"> Villa - Full Stack Engineer </a></h3>
  <p> I was brought on as the second engineering hire to complete a mobile application and create the web application in 12 weeks
  in hopes of pursuing a seed round. The mobile app was constructed with React Native and Redux for the user interface with a Rails API and Postgres db comprising the backend. Both served as a communication and organizational platform for the residential construction industry.

  <h3> ><a href="https://generalassemb.ly/"> General Assembly - Instructional Associate</a></h3>
  <p>After graduating from General Assembly's Web Development Immersive, I went on to work with the lead instructors in the subsequent cohort to facilitate code reviews and break down concepts of OOP, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React.js, HTML, and CSS. I was able to create new content and dive deeper into the curriculum I just worked through as a student, except this time from the perspective of an educator. This greatly improved my technical communication skills to both novice and advanced software engineers.  
</p>

  <h3> > Yelp - Account Executive </h3>
  <p> After two months of extensive training in Salesforce and developing our own lead pipelines, I hit slightly over 250% of quota in my first month, which was the first month new employees began working under a quota at Yelp. This was a high-volume sales role with target metrics set close to 80+ calls/day and roughly two hours of talking time. </p>

  <h3> ><a href="http://blog.jamplify.com/"> Jamplify - Community Manager</a></h3>
  <p> I helped with customer support related for beta testing and generated analytic insights that were converted into action points for clients to implement in their marketing campaigns. Additionally I oversaw user satisfaction and engagement within a multitude of campaigns while locating and engaging new fans. Initially, users(music fans) acted as promoters for local shows and were incentivized by VIP tickets and prize packages. However, it became clear that the analytics gathered on  various artists, their on-sale campaigns, and the engagement with their advertising filled a need within the industry, so the team pivoted to make analytics the focal point of the product. I began teaching myself Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS at the time, and between freelance Wordpress design and some occasional mentorship from the lead developers, thus began my journey into software development. </p>
