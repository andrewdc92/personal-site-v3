<p>Born and raised in New Jersey, I studied at the Gabelli School of Business at Fordham University, majoring in Entrepreneurship and Business Administration. This path exposed me to courses including information systems and philosophy, which planted the seeds for shifting towards computer programming, as I found myself enjoying the logic of laying out premises and fallacies. I started writing for several music blogs during my freshmen year, and then created a Wordpress blog to write on my own time. </p>

<p>I started working two different marketing + analytic internships sophomore year, as Fordham is a short twenty minute train ride outside of Manhattan and I had off from class every Wednesday to foster internships. I enjoyed working with tools like Google Analytics and Hootsuite, and also continued to work on Wordpress platforms for Guest of a Guest, which grew my familiarity with HTML and CSS best practices. I went on to meet the team at Jamplify, where I helped out part time for two years as community manager, handling a wide array of responsibilities as the product pivoted from an engagement tool to an analytic platform after my first year. The team was incredibly impressive to me, seemingly lightyears ahead of other teams I had worked on to that point, and it was my first exposure to seeing two engineers build out and refine this seemingly massive web application, and **our users really liked the product**. </p>

<p>I started working on custom Wordpress sites for friends and family before discovering OneMonthRails. Without much understanding, I dove in, committing to Rails at the time because of it's fame (or notoriety) at the time for prototyping rapidly and scaling applications. After graduating from Fordham, I moved out to San Diego for some personal and professional exploration. After a year in SoCal, the stars and opportunities aligned and we were lucky enough to land jobs in San Francisco. The rest is history. I quit my sales job after making enough money for some stability in the Bay Area and went to a web development bootcamp at General Assembly to learn about Javascript and build on my past experience with Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS.  </p>

<p> When I'm not coding, you can find me biking around Marin, playing guitar, enjoying a long weightlifting session, or spending time with Julianne, friends, and family. All of my endeavors are fueled by passion and coffee.
